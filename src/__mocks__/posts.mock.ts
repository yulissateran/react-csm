      '<div>\n  <img\n    alt=""\n    width="100%"\n    height="329"\n    loading="eager"\n    role="presentation"\n    src="https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*x-NikaoEVpCK6jhEo_t63g.png"\n  />\n  <p>\n    <span>O</span>nce somebody asked me <em>“Why you left digital agencies and went to work on the product-side?”. My </em>answer was simple\n    as that:<strong><em> “because I wanted design for people, not for brands.”</em></strong>\n  </p>\n</div>\n<div>\n  <p>\n    I worked at various agencies for years and for the most part, I loved it. Designers could work on Nike one day and have a portfolio full\n    of big brands. I can’t lie, that felt like a dream job. But I noticed that not only I, but a lot of other “agency” designers, started to\n    feel like something was missing after a while. The big-brand-projects became less and less fulfilling. I realized that all of that work\n    was been done for someone in particular: the brand. Making things beautiful and creating crazy interactions is nice, but I couldn’t see\n    my designs improving someone’s day-to-day. When your job is to focused on solving problems for the client, and not the customer, it’s\n    hard to know what kind of impact your work has.\n  </p>\n  <p>When customers use your product every single day, one little change made can save them a ton of time.</p>\n  <p>\n    Transitioning from agency designer to product designer is not easy, but knowing what to expect makes can help you to adapt first. The\n    challenge is to find out what do you like to do and pick the side that fits you better.\n  </p>\n  <h1>The Product Designer vs. The UX Designer</h1>\n  <p>In the end of the day, it’s all about solving problems. The difference here is the type of problems you’re working on:</p>\n  <p>\n    Designers at agencies are more like <strong>UX Designers</strong>. They design to solve short-term user experiences. There’s a lot of\n    creativity planning interactions, but there’s a lack of data, tracking and business model involved to make it a long term product. It’s\n    more about creativity, usability and user journeys, than solving real world problems. The daily data doesn’t affect so much the final\n    result as much as the brand experience has to. There’s not much flexibily and resources for deep user researches with real users and\n    there’s no follow up on the problem.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    The reason why <strong>Product Designers</strong> are called like that, is that they not only look up for the user experience (the UX),\n    but they combine that with a solid business knowledge that will lead to a longer product life. A product, differently than an brand app\n    release, or a street instalation, is something that generate business value and is driven by a considerable numbers of active users\n    performing one habit forming task. That’s why working in product design allows you to have much more insights on data and iterate on\n    your experiments and the product envolves.\n  </p>\n  <h1>Variety of work</h1>\n  <p>\n    One of the best parts of being a designer at an agency is the variety of work. You got to tackle a lot of business and design problems\n    in a very short period of time and for different clients. You can be spending your first 4 hours working for an automobile brand and the\n    next 4 switch over to a beauty business.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    The true story is: when you’re working in tech, most of the work you do is to iterate on your product. Because there are people actually\n    using it everyday, it is important to track your data, experiment on your hypotheses, measure results and iterate as you go. People and\n    technology are always changing; the results you get now may vary in 6 months, and that’s why this vicious cycle of iteration is\n    important.\n  </p>\n  <h1>Different roles and flexible teams</h1>\n  <p>The type of people you collaborate with are different, there’s not a product management role in agencies, for instance.</p>\n  <p>In agencies it’s pretty comum that you end up working with the same peers in a static waterfall model.</p>\n  <p>\n    Some companies have flexible teams that rotate their people from time to time. This is a great way to keep a fresh eye and mind on the\n    product. The teams at agencies are structure to best serve the client needs focusing on branding and marketing awareness. The final idea\n    becames more important than the final user.\n  </p>\n  <h1>Ideas <em>vs. E</em>xecution</h1>\n  <p>There’s a leap between agencies and tech companies, and that’s is, what matters the most?</p>\n  <p>\n    Whereas at agencies, the capital is creative ideas being generated, in tech it’s all about the delivery and the impact of a high quality\n    execution.\n  </p>\n  <h1>Measurement of sucess</h1>\n  <p>\n    The way you measure what is a good piece of work is different in both cases. A good piece of work in an agency could be what a client\n    really liked or saw potentials to get business outside of it.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    In a tech world, a good piece of work might be something that might be smaller, but might have tremendous material impact on the\n    business.\n  </p>\n  <h1>How can I know where I should go?</h1>\n  <p>\n    If you’re a designer driven by the chalenges of doing something different every time and you feel like your work need to be flexible,\n    you can be a good fit for digital agencies.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    If you want to design data driven or data informed products, keep track on your results, have a deeper understanding of a product\n    business and work in flexible teams within agile structures, than my friend, the tech world would love you.\n  </p>\n</div>\n<div>\n  <p>\n    <em>Thanks for stopping by! :)</em>\n  </p>\n</div>\n',

Working at Apple, the holy grail of minimalistic design, innovation and creativity. A\n        place where misfits have a seat on the table and where bold, crazy ideas as highly encouraged. As a Product Designer, working at\n        Apple was a life changing experience, and all I can say is that I’ll keep carrying some of its principles with me wherever I go. In\n        the one year that I worked at Apple, here are the top 10 lessons I learned:\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div><hr/></div>\n    <div>\n      <p><strong>TL;DR</strong></p>\n      <ul>\n        <li>\n          Apple is a unique company and I believe that the way they do product design can only be successful due to their business model,\n          which allows for innovation, failure, risks, and strong focus on design craft excellence, even if it takes a long time to get\n          there.\n        </li>\n        <li>Build a great product, not an MVP.</li>\n        <li>Storytelling is the best skill we need to develop as product designers.</li>\n        <li>A top-down culture is not as bad as we think.</li>\n      </ul>\n      <p>\n        <em>Disclaimer: The opinions presented here are all based on my experience and don’t necessarily reflect how Apple operates.</em>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div><hr/></div>\n    <div>\n      <h1>Great design will take you far, great communication will take you even further: influence people and move things forward.</h1>\n      <p>\n        Projects get built when enough people believe in them. From small talks to elaborating decisions to VP presentations. The way we\n        speak, project ourselves and elaborate our thoughts is fundamental for getting consensus, influencing people, and moving things\n        forward.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        My biggest learning was to put passion into my speech. Not only when presenting work, but e<em>specially</em> when talking in\n        meetings. Be truly excited about your work and show this excitement to everyone working around you.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Jobs had an amazing ability to make his ideas understandable and memorable because he spoke with passion.\n        <mark>People may not remember what you said, but they will remember how </mark><mark><em>you made them feel</em></mark\n        ><mark>: confident, interested, optimistic, bored, reluctant, etc.</mark>\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        At the end of the day, we’re not only selling products to customers externally, but also selling our ideas to teams and stakeholders\n        internally, and the key to any successful sale is communication.\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div><hr/></div>\n    <div>\n      <h1>Storytelling is your superpower: are we deck designers after all?</h1>\n      <p>\n        One of the things that surprised me the most was to see that for <em>any</em> piece of work being shared, designers would put\n        together a keynote deck for it. It could be the smallest thing, like a quick look at the latest work progression, or big\n        presentations, of course. At Apple, designers use the power of storytelling to influence others, instead of just showing what they\n        are doing.\n      </p>\n      <p>A few tips I learned when presenting work on decks are:</p>\n      <ul>\n        <li>Tell a story instead of explaining the process.</li>\n        <li>\n          Only focus on one idea per slide. Don’t confuse what you’re saying by having busy slides. Use one bold sentence per slide. Instead\n          of paragraphs of text.\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          Use presenter notes as a script for your speech. Let the image/mockups paint the picture of what you’re saying in the background.\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          Rehearse your presentations. Even if it’s just a small design critique for a few designers, take one hour or less before the\n          meeting to go through your narrative and know exactly what you need to say to get straight to the point.\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          Have fun! It goes back to how you want people to feel and how helping people feel optimistic during your presentation will help\n          you gain their trust and move things forward (even if the work needs some iteration).\n        </li>\n      </ul>\n    </div>\n    <div><hr/></div>\n    <div>\n      <h1>Big ideas are more important than usability fixes: the art of balancing long-term vs. short-term goals.</h1>\n      <p>\n        One thing I noticed is that most of the product teams won’t spend their bandwidth working on small wins and fixes. Instead, teams\n        are focused on long-term impact and building the <em>next big thing</em>. This might explain why every year we see at WWDC Apple\n        releasing a new great feature that will blow our minds, but <em>that</em> small minor usability issue is still there.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        It comes down to the company culture. Apple is known for being an innovative brand, so there’s a natural expectation that the\n        company will be working towards releasing innovative products and experiences and this affects how the company prioritizes its\n        efforts.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        So I guess the learning is, if you want to be innovative, focus on the big wins instead of the small ones. Even if it takes more\n        time to get there.\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div><hr/></div>\n    <div>\n      <h1>Trust your instinct, you’re an expert: in making decisions without user testing.</h1>\n      <p>In the ideal world, whenever we’re designing, we user test to spot any red flags on usability or accessibility.</p>\n      <p>\n        At Apple, you can’t just go out there and use usertesting.com to test your new designs. Imagine if word gets on the street and\n        everyone knows what exciting new feature Apple is working on. You need to find new ways to test your designs, without compromising\n        their secrecy of it.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        One of the ways to do that is by running internal user tests with selected employees. Another way is to rely on expert reviews.\n        Expert reviews are design critiques with highly knowledgeable people, usually design directors, VP of products, and managers. The\n        stakes are high and you have to elaborate on the intentionality behind every single design choice. You might think this is a biased\n        way of making decisions, but I’ve found those sessions way more valuable than any user testing I’ve been in. The amount of detail\n        that gets challenged is unbelievable and you can see that the brightest people are looking after the user experience so these\n        products are easy and simple to use.\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div><hr/></div>\n    <div>\n      <h1>Being a highly-output generator over a strategic thinker.</h1>\n      <p>\n        People say that Apple is a dream company for any designer and I believe most of it is since as a designer at Apple, you focus most\n        of your time on one thing: the craft. The execution. How the product will behave (interaction design), look (visual design), and\n        make people feel and scale on the ecosystem (system design).\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        And to have time to focus on craft and execution — and master the details — there’s an amazing smart product team (PMs, PMMs, etc)\n        that will focus on product thinking and strategy.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        I do have to say that I missed being more involved in product decisions. I was in charge of interaction and system design decisions,\n        but I often missed having a seat at the table to think through the product strategy.\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div><hr/></div>\n    <div>\n      <h1>“One more thing”: going beyond the problem you’re solving.</h1>\n      <p>\n        You probably remember the One More Thing practice initiated by Steve. Well, that applies to the work inside Apple as well. This is\n        not a mandatory thing, but I saw it quite a lot, and to be honest, I loved it.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        It’s the <em>bonus</em> culture. As I said, everything is a presentation and all presentations are on the keynote. <em>Bonus</em> is\n        a deck section that will go last on your presentation and it shows how you went above and beyond to explore other opportunities\n        related to your project, some stretch goal, or new ways of winning.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        In summary, it’s a chance to <strong>push the team to think bigger</strong> and look at other opportunities that are not being\n        considered (or can’t at the moment). What I love about this culture is it gives designers a safe space to share their creative ideas\n        while getting visibility from stakeholders, without the pressure and judgment of “having” to build it. If it gets buy-in, great, if\n        not, it’s always good to have food for thought!\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div><hr/></div>\n    <div><h1>Simplicity is hard. Very hard. But when you get it, it’s beautiful.</h1></div>\n    <div><hr/></div>\n    <div>\n      <h1>Build a great product, not an MVP: maintaining a reputation of excellence.</h1>\n      <p>\n        When you buy an Apple product you don’t expect it to be in a testing phase. You expect a product of its highest quality and\n        performance. This hardware development culture is also reflected in the software and service development culture at Apple.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        I’ll never forget this one time when I was at a meeting with a product team from Apple TV, and someone said that we could do a\n        release on the web and mobile platform, but we didn’t have the experience ready for TV. So the PM said\n        <em\n          >“if we can’t launch the best experience across all our platforms now, we’re not launching it at all. If we need to wait another\n          year to deliver the best experience for our customers, we’ll wait.”</em\n        >\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        I even got the chills! Never in my entire career have I heard a PM saying that we would delay the release to launch the best\n        experience that people deserve to get.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        I guess this story says a lot about the culture of excellence at Apple. Lots of people complain about how Apple takes a long time to\n        launch features or products that the competition already has, but I truly believe this is due to the culture of just launching a\n        product when we think it will be an amazing experience for people. And I know that this software development culture is only\n        possible at Apple since the company is in a unique position of having a business model that allows for that.\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div><hr/></div>\n    <div>\n      <h1>Learn to say “no”.</h1>\n      <p>\n        This is one of the best things I’ve learned in my career. Learning to say no it’s all about learning how to prioritize impact.\n        There’s only so much our brain can take and we can get done in a week. It’s important to put your energy into projects, meetings,\n        and activities that will bring the most impact. And because at big tech companies, there are always exciting projects and\n        opportunities all around, it’s quite easy to get involved in everything at once. But the best way to leave your mark is to deliver\n        in great quality, what you promised. So, don’t eat more than what you can take.\n      </p>\n      <blockquote>\n        <p>\n          “People think focus means saying yes to the thing you’ve got to focus on. But that’s not what it means at all. It means saying no\n          to the hundred other good ideas that there are. You have to pick carefully.” Steve Jobs\n        </p>\n      </blockquote>\n    </div>\n    <div><hr/></div>\n    <div>\n      <h1>A top-down culture is not as bad as we think.</h1>\n      <p>\n        Last but not least, one of the most distinctive traits of Apple is the top-down company. This means there’s a culture of presenting\n        work to Directors, Managers, etc, and getting their approval to move forward.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Every time I had a director or design lead disagreeing with my point of view, they were damn right. And that’s because, at Apple,\n        there’s not much ego involved. I found that people are truly looking for the best user experience possible. So if someone disagrees\n        with your point of view, they probably have a pretty good reason for that. There’s a safe space for a healthy debate and again,\n        all-around intentionality.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        The reason why I loved the top-down culture at Apple is that important decisions are taken faster. Having an expert giving you green\n        light or not keeps the momentum. How many times in a bottom-up culture, do we spend weeks and weeks, sometimes even months, trying\n        to get alignment with +10 people, because every single person needs to agree with the point of view? It is exhausting.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        So again, my experience is that having that one leader to look up to to help guide decisions is time-saving, it helps us focus on\n        the design craft, instead of project managing.\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div><hr/></div>\n    <div>\n      <h1>thank you for reading☺︎thank you for reading☺︎</h1>\n      <p><em>_</em></p>\n      <p>Andrea P.</p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</section>\n',

Fast forward two decades and I find myself\n  right in the midst of an exciting transformation here at Office, where both the experience and its brand are evolving into an exciting new\n  direction.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Some of the most obvious catalysts for this evolution were both the\n  <a\n    rel="noopener"\n    href="/microsoft-design/designing-for-power-simplicity-9cddec615567?source=friends_link&amp;sk=76b42eba31c147cf9d6707e5994fcf55"\n    >simplification of our core experiences</a\n  >\n  and later, the\n  <a\n    rel="noopener"\n    href="/microsoft-design/redesigning-the-office-app-icons-to-embrace-a-new-world-of-work-91d72608ee8f?source=friends_link&amp;sk=499905fb0d5a65d594aab35201debf40"\n    >redesign of our experience icons</a\n  >, both of which contributed significantly to the overall aesthetic and functionality of the new and modern Office.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Last December, we\n  <a\n    rel="noopener"\n    href="/microsoft-design/the-ripple-effect-expanding-our-icon-design-system-74b4d916b7a4?source=friends_link&amp;sk=1ae4647a990e201768e6ad72eac8b4f4"\n    >revealed yet another set of icon designs</a\n  >, including one for Office itself. The timing of this brand evolution was in sync with the reveal of the brand-new Office mobile app,\n  which combines Word, Excel and PowerPoint with uniquely mobile ways that make document creation easier.\n</p>\n<p>\n  As we began the redesign process for the Office icon, we were eager to simply crack open Adobe Illustrator and begin generating ideas.\n  Although we did some of that, we also discovered that the challenges of revisiting such a widely known icon were actually much larger than\n  we had expected. After all, for many, it represented a beloved and familiar set of creation tools that had been around since the 1980\'s.\n</p>\n<img\n  alt="A sequence of icons that shows the evolution of the Microsoft Office brand since it was first announced in 1988."\n  width="100%"\n  height="394"\n  loading="lazy"\n  src="https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*jH1HHoGUmpGc074uWEFhzA.jpeg"\n/>\n<p>\n  With many variations of the icon pinned across our design studio and research results starting to fill our inboxes, we began to\n  collectively gravitate towards the familiar threshold shape that our customers were already accustomed to. We added depth, a richer color\n  palette and softer, friendlier silhouette to align its aesthetics with our other icons.\n</p>\n<img\n  alt="The shape of the new Microsoft Office icon."\n  width="100%"\n  height="214"\n  loading="lazy"\n  src="https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*-pOKBr6JsoozS-b1BMHl6g.png"\n/>\n<img\n  alt="The color palette we developed for the new Microsoft Office icon."\n  width="100%"\n  height="214"\n  loading="lazy"\n  src="https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*K5pw5JEHX88pYhc9-KJMHQ.png"\n/>\n<p>\n  Below are just a few among the many shapes we explored over many weeks of iteration. These largely revolved around the metaphor of an\n  opening, a vessel or a container for creation tools.\n</p>\n<figure>\n  <iframe\n    src="https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fplayer.vimeo.com%2Fvideo%2F652756120%3Fh%3Df072b31f06%26app_id%3D122963&amp;dntp=1&amp;display_name=Vimeo&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fplayer.vimeo.com%2Fvideo%2F652756120%3Fh%3Df072b31f06%26title%3D0%26byline%3D0%26portrait%3D0&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.vimeocdn.com%2Fvideo%2F1317185723-0b875de5f30527439866d0b7f64c4e65710480d6fdea672ad4c5537f8ba4c668-d_1280&amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=vimeo"\n    allowfullscreen=""\n    frameborder="0"\n    height="300"\n    width="100%"\n    title="Office Icon Loop"\n    scrolling="auto"\n  ></iframe>\n</figure>\n<p>\n  In retrospect, this project wasn’t all that different from the smaller brand assignments I had worked on early in my career. It took some\n  creativity, attention to detail and rigor, as well as some courage and gut instinct.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Ultimately what really set this apart from my previous experiences was all the cross-team collaboration. Instead of relying on a\n  traditional design and approval processes, we inspired each other along the way and depended heavily on our collective insights,\n  intuition, experience and candor.\n</p>\n<p>\n  I’ll let you be the judge of the final result, but I am incredibly proud of this group of people below and excited about where the Office\n  experience along with its brand-new icon is headed.\n</p>\n',
